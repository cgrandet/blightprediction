## Model Exploration
This folder has two jupyter notebooks that analyze models and provide statistics
to show the selection of the top models according to certain parameters.

get_csv is a file that creates a CSV out of a MongodB database with models 

The Lab model exploration.ipynb file analyzes models parameters and features to find distribution of results, model correlation and stability

The Predictions Exploration jupyter notebook analyzes the predictions of each model and finds how reactive are they to changes in parameters
